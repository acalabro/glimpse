/**
 * The GlimpseBaseEvent <T> is the generic basic event that the monitoring infrastructure<br />
 * uses to infer more complex events. These object must be sent from a probe<br />
 * to GLIMPSE through the ESB.<br /><br />
 * 
 * The parameter of GlimpseBaseEvent(String, String, String, String, int, int, Long, String, boolean)<br />
 * are useful to provide information about the connector where the probe is instanciated.<br /><br />
 * Extending the GlimpseBaseEvent(String, String, String, String, int, int, Long, String, boolean) class<br />
 * it's possible to add or change variables and to manages it into the CEP using a well-formed Drools rule.<br />
